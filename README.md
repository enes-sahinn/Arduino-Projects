# Arduino Projects

This is a collection of Arduino projects.

## Projects

### [5-bit LED Counter](../master/5-bit-led-counter)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

A 5-bit LED counter that takes two integer values from the serial monitor. One is for the increment operation and the second is for the waiting time between counting operations.

Components used:
* Arduino Uno
* 5 X LEDs
* Some resistors and wires

### [DHT11 Monitor](../master/DHT11-Monitor)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

A DHT11 MonÄ±tor that get current temperature and humidity in the environment by using the DHT11 sensor. And, shows this info on the LCD screen.

Components used:
* Arduino Uno
* 10KOhm Potentiometer
* DHT11 Sensor
* LCD Screen
* Push down button
* Some resistors and wires

### [Buzzer Controller](../master/buzzer-controller)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

A buzzer control program over serial monitor. Takes 4 inputs over serial monitor, first one is the length of buzzer sound, second is the length of silence between sounds, third is the length of silence between periods and fourth is the sound string that will be played on buzzer, where 0 is silence and 1 is sound.

Components used:
* Arduino Uno
* Buzzer
* Some resistors and wires
